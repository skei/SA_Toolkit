bugs:
------------------------------

* random cpu spikes in bitwig (synth)

  4-5 seconds interval
  performance meter in bitwig says they last around 30 ms
  (no spikes with internal devices)
  when i select "inside bitwig" or what it's called, so that the plugins
  are called within bitwig, and not as a separate process, there's no
  spikes.. something related to context switching? thread priorities?
  similar spiking with u-he synths too, so it'Ã¦s not my code..
  no similar reports in bitwig forums..
  so it might be caused by my pipewire setup..
  investigate...
  
todo:
------------------------------

* 'delete this'

  is the 'delete this' in SAT_Plugin.destroy() correct/working?
  printouts in destructors indicates it works..
  but memtrace, and also memcheck (codelite plugin, valgrind?)
  says there's memory leaks..
  
* SAT_LockFreeQueue

  double/triple/quadruple-check validity..
  
* cleanup, redefine SAT_GLOBAL / DEBUG, LOG, PRINT

  make them available (defined) _before_ defining plugin/gui stuff..
  so we can print and log from the lowest levels..

plugin

======================================================================

bugs:
------------------------------

* vst3: doesn't remember editor size when reopening

todo:
------------------------------

* plugin: parameter smoothing

  a value in a synth might use a combination of:
  parameter + modulation + note expressions + (internal modulation)
  (and smoothed individually per voice)
  so we should probably smooth the _combination_ of these
  -> modulation matix/routing system?

* plugin: save editor state (editor_state)

* plugin: SAT_InstrumentPlugin, SAT_AudioEffectPlugin, JesusonicPlugin (for easy porting), ..

* plugin: reaper extensions

* plugin: ara

* plugin: presets

  ~/.skei.audio/presets/*.sa_preset
  text file: line 1: id of plugin, 2: name, 3: author, 4: description, 5: load key,
  6..: hex-encoded data, maybe dmc compressed?
  SAT_Plugin.loadPreset(uint8_t* data) ?

======================================================================

gui

======================================================================

bugs:
------------------------------

* win32: scroll-wheel breaks mouse responsitivity
  (can't reproduce in exe? fixed?)
  todo: check..
  
* win32: resizing doesn't update screen properly (exe only?)

* win32, clap, carla..
  resize doesn't update screen
  (do we receive resize events?)

todo:
------------------------------

* gui: investigate text/font alignment & accuracy

* gui: window aspect ratio during resizing

* gui: cached widgets (buffer, dirty_flag to update)

* gui: opengl shaders
