* random cpu spikes in bitwig (synth)

  3-4 seconds interval
  performance meter in bitwig says they last around 30 ms
  (no spikes with internal devices)
  investigate
  
* parameter/modulation smoothing

  a value in a synth might use a combination of:
  parameter + modulation + note expressions + (internal modulatio)
  (and smoothed individually per voice)
  so we need to find a way to smooth the _combination_ of these

* culling & clipping

  no drawing outside parent boundaries
  set clipping to parent rect before drawing child widgets
  each widget could additionally clip itself (if needed)
  or a flag/bool for handling it automatically

* generid editor

* investigate text/font alignment & accuracy

* window aspect ratio during resizing
  
* cached widgets (buffer, dirty_flag to update)

* layout/alignment

* scrollable container
