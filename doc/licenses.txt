licenses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

my code, wherever i am allowed to choose the license, it's mit

i have tried to keep track of where everything is from, by keeping
comments in the source code itself, but there's some more substantial
pieces that deserves more mentioning, especially code in the
'/src/extern' folder, so if you use any code from there, or things
that are derived from it, be sure to adhere to these licenses too

if i do something wrong by either including them, or basing
my own code (which is mit licensed) on them, let me know, and i will
fix it!
