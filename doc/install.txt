(copy-paste from older text file..)

just completely wiped my system disk, and reinstalled linux..
and during re-installation of my development setup, i wrote down the dependencies i had to install before i compiled correctly:

  libx11-dev
  libx11-xcb-dev
( libxcb1-dev )
  libxcb-util-dev
  xcb-keysyms1-dev
  libxkbcommon-dev
  libxcb-xkb-dev
( libopengl-dev )
  mesa-common-dev
  libglu1-mesa-dev
  freeglut3-dev

() = not sure if needed, or automatically dragged in as dependency for some of the other deps..
