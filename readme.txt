plugin toolkit/framework

---

[todo, sketch]
initially the base code toolkit for all the SA (skei.audio) plugins, but now a bit more generic and hopefully useful for other projects and people.. based on clap, with wrappers to and from other formats (vst2, vst3, ladspa, standalone exe).. currently supports linux and windows, no mac version planned.. gpu-accelerated, freely scalable (vector) gui.. all clap goodies (polyphonic modulation, voice stacking, thread pool..).. simplified, abstracted, streamlined for rapid installation/setup, prototyping, iterations..
