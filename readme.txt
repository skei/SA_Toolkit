"initially the base code toolkit for all the SA (skei.audio) plugins, but now
 a bit more generic and hopefully useful for other projects and people..
 100% based on clap, with wrappers to and from other plugin formats (vst2/3,
 ladspa, lv2, standalone exe).. clap/ladspa hosting (other formats coming too,
 probably).. currently supports linux and windows.. gpu-accelerated, freely
 scalable (vector) gui.. all clap goodies (poly modulation, voice stacking,
 thread pool, remote controls, preset discovery, parameter indication, sample
 accurate..), voice manager with threaded voices, etc, etc.. simplified,
 abstracted, streamlined for rapid installation/setup, prototyping, and
 further iterations.."
