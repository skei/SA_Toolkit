plugin toolkit/framework

---

[todo, sketch]

initially the base code toolkit for all the SA (skei.audio) plugins, but now a bit more generic and hopefully useful for other projects and people.. 100% based on clap, with wrappers to and from other plugin formats (vst2/3, ladspa, lv2, standalone exe).. clap/ladspa hosting (other formats coming too, probably).. currently supports linux and windows, no mac version planned.. gpu-accelerated, freely scalable (vector) gui.. all clap goodies (poly modulation, voice stacking, thread pool, remote controls, preset discovery, parameter indication, sample accurate..), voice manager with threaded voices, overlapping notes, polyphonic modulation, etc, etc).. simplified, abstracted, streamlined for rapid installation/setup, prototyping, iterations..
